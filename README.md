## Side Note ##

    Anno 1800 Expedition Helper is a project heavily inspired by the Website **Anno 1800 App (https://www.anno-expeditions.app)**

    The project sets to recreate the website but in **TSX** ( the original one have been made in **Vue.js**)

    No usage of AI, **pure Brain Power and it hurts.**

    Some features haven't been discussed in class, such as Interfaces, but I have learned them at my work and some others by my previous experiences ( even before my arrival at HETIC)

    I really hope that the project will meet your expectations.

    My work on this site isn't finished yet. 
    I would like to continue it into the year

    ###Notable future feature being : 

    ###-Better looking Styles
    -Better Error Handling
    -More Items and goods
    -More Dynamic and ergonomic expedition creation
    -And overall, a better Design.
    -Dockerize the whole application**
